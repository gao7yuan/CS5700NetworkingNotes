## what is internet
- components
  - hosts
  - communication links
  - packet switches
- structure
  - network edge
  - network core

- network edge
  - hosts: clients and servers
  - access network
  - frequency division multiplexing
    - higher freq range, higher data rate (bandwidth)
- network core
  - interconnected routers
    - two key functions for each router
      - routing: source to destination route taken by packets
      - forwarding: packets from routers input port to output port
  - *packet switching*
    - packet switching vs. frequency division multiplexing
    - break application layer msg to packets
    - forward packets from one router to the next
    - each packet transmitted at full link capacity
    - trade-off for better resource sharing
- internet structure
  - ISP
  - IXP
  - content provider network
  - regional net

## protocol
- protocol layers
  - application
    - format and meaning of messages
    - e.g. HTTP, SMTP
  - transport
    - communication between a pair of *applications(processes)*
    - reliable delivery and retransmission
    - control data rate
    - e.g. TCP, UDP
  - network
    - communication between a pair of *computers* across the internet
    - packet format(datagram)
    - internet address
    - e.g. IP protocol
  - link
    - communication between computer and network hardware
    - MAC layer, network interface layer
    - media access (printer)
    - packet format(frame)
    - hardware address(MAC)
  - physical
    - 0-1 signal, electrical properties

## key metrics
- delay aka latency
  - processing delay
  - transmission delay
    - L/R (L = packet length, R = link data rate)
  - propagation delay
    - d/s (d = length of physical link, s = propagation speed)
  - queuing delay
- throughput (bits / time unit)
- loss
